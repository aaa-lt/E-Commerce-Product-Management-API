### Project Overview

#### Project Title: **E-Commerce Product Management API**

This project aims to build a RESTful API for managing an e-commerce product catalog. The API will be developed using Express and will interact with a MySQL database deployed via Docker. The API will enable users to perform CRUD operations on products, categories, suppliers, and customer orders. It will also include user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure certain endpoints.

### Requirements

#### 1. **Project Stack:**

- NodeJS
- Express
- Sequelize
- MySQL (Dockerized)
- JWT
- Swagger

#### 2. **Database Schema:**

The MySQL database should include at least five tables, with the following suggested structure:

1. **Users** (for storing user details)
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `username`
   - `password_hash`
   - `email`
   - `is_admin` (Boolean to denote admin users)

2. **Products**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `description`
   - `price`
   - `creation_date` (Timestamp): Automatically set when a new product is added.
   - `category_id` (Foreign Key to Categories)
   - `supplier_id` (Foreign Key to Suppliers)

3. **Categories**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `description`

4. **Suppliers**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `contact_email`
   - `phone_number`

5. **Orders**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
   - `product_id` (Foreign Key to Products)
   - `quantity`
   - `order_date`
   - `status` (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled)

#### 3. **Endpoints:**

The API should include the following endpoints:

1. **User Authentication:**
    - `POST /auth/login` endpoint should authenticate a user, return a JWT tokens in the response body, and also set the JWT token as a cookie.
    - `POST /auth/logout` endpoint that clears the JWT cookies, effectively logging the user out by invalidating the session.
    - `POST /auth/register` Registers a new user in the system.
    - `POST /auth/refresh` Refreshes access token

2. **User Management:**
   - `GET /users/me`: Retrieve the current userâ€™s details (requires JWT).
   - `GET /users/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific user (Admin only, requires JWT).

3. **Product Management:**
   - `GET /products/`: Retrieve a list of products, optionally filtered by category or supplier.
   - `GET /products/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific product.
   - `POST /products/`: Create a new product (Admin only, requires JWT).
   - `PUT /products/{id}`: Update an existing product (Admin only, requires JWT).
   - `DELETE /products/{id}`: Delete a product (Admin only, requires JWT).

4. **Category Management:**
   - `GET /categories/`: Retrieve a list of product categories.
   - `POST /categories/`: Create a new category (Admin only, requires JWT).

5. **Supplier Management:**
   - `GET /suppliers/`: Retrieve a list of suppliers.
   - `POST /suppliers/`: Create a new supplier (Admin only, requires JWT).

6. **Order Management:**
   - `GET /orders/`: Retrieve a list of orders (Admin only, requires JWT).
   - `GET /orders/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific order (requires JWT).
   - `POST /orders/`: Create a new order (requires JWT).
   - `PUT /orders/{id}`: Update the status of an order (Admin only, requires JWT).

7. **Search:**
   - `GET /search/`:  
     Implement an endpoint to search across products, categories, and suppliers using a query parameter. The search functionality should support the following criteria:
     - **Product Name:** Search by product name.
     - **Product Creation Date:** Filter products by their creation date.
     - **Product Price:** Search for products within a specific price range.
     - **Category Name:** Search by the name of the product's category.
     - **Supplier Name:** Search by the name of the supplier.
